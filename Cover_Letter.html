Greetings,

<p>
I’m looking for experience in the Computer Science field to propel my career in Artificial Intelligence. I’m a junior in Old Dominion University’s online degree program. I’m hoping to use the flexibility of my class schedule and location to work in the field as quickly as possible.
</p>
<p>
&#9;My first experience with programming occurred during my junior year of high school, where I learned Visual Basics. I really latched on to the experience and ended up helping most of the people in the class. Any time I’m doing a programming project, I get entranced by the project. I lose track of time and become solely focused. I enjoy solving problems.
</p>
<p>
&#9;One of my big interests is robotics. In my senior year of high school, I got an enlightening experience working with a robot in the FIRST Robotics club at my high school. I enjoyed the experience because I became creative when faced with all the problems and issues that arose. In my Introduction to Engineering Workshop class at UVA, I  was tasked to an assignment involving maze searching with a robot we designed in lab. My other similar interests in the Computer Science field is Artificial Intelligence. I’ve always been smart, so I think I could contribute to systems that break down and model intelligence.
